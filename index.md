Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my first day of using github.
I was planing to learn github and start collaborating with new people and start new projects for a long time now, but today i finally started learning github.
Github is a great place where you can so many stuffs, such as:
1. Creating a Repository/Project.
2. Let other developers/teamates to see and collaborate with you.
3. It helps developers to have easy access to their project anywhere just few clicks away.
4. Also developers can see and learn from other developes project which is really helpful.
5. It allow us to make contirbution to open source which can make great impact for the developer community.
